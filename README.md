# image-annotation-tools

Implementation of 4 different image annotation models:

- GRiT [(Original Repository)](https://github.com/JialianW/GRiT)
- CLIP [(Original Repository)](https://github.com/rmokady/CLIP_prefix_caption)
- YOLOv7 [(Original Repository)](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)
- CRAFT [(Original Repository)](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch)

All models fetch the images from the ```Ã¬mages``` folder and use them as input

### Future work:

- [ ] Add YOLO results visualization
- [ ] Add CRAFT results visualization

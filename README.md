# image-annotation-tools

Implementation of 4 different image annotation models:

- [GRiT](https://github.com/JialianW/GRiT)
- [CLIP](https://github.com/rmokady/CLIP_prefix_caption)
- [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)
- [CRAFT](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch)

All models fetch the images from the ``Ã¬mages``` folder and use them as input

### Future work:

- [ ] Add YOLO results visualization
- [ ] Add CRAFT results visualization
